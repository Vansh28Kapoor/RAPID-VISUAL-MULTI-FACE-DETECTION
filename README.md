We implemented the Haar features-based Adaboost Cascade Classifier approach utilizing the Integral Image Representation technique for rapid computation of Haar features, which was then used for classifier learning. Later on we also compared its speed with classical approaches by implementing methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks. At the end we integrated the Python code with a live webcam, enabling real-time face detection with the help of bounding boxes.
